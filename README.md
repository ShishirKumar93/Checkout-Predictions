# Seattle Public Library System Book Check Out Predictions

Beginning with over 35 Gigabytes of data, we predict which books will be predicted over the next month. This is a binary classification problem, where we utilized PySpark, Amazon EMR, and H2O. Through feature engineering and testing several different machine learning algorithms (including logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosted trees, and H2O's AutoML), we were able to achieve over 0.91 ROC AUC and 0.80 PR AUC.
